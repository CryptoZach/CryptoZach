# Unified Fed Paper Data Pipeline — Claude Code Task Brief

## Target Publication
**Paper:** "Regulating Routers: The Control Layer of Internet-Native Dollars"
**Venue:** Fifth Conference on International Roles of the U.S. Dollar (Fed Board & FRBNY)
**Date:** June 22-23, 2026

---

## Executive Summary

This unified pipeline combines two complementary analyses:

### Package 1: Monetary Policy Transmission (COMPLETE)
- **Core Finding:** r = -0.94 correlation between Fed Balance Sheet and stablecoin supply
- **Exhibits 1-8:** Supply trends, rate sensitivity, market structure, RRP rotation, DEX volumes
- **Data:** FRED macro series + DefiLlama stablecoin mcaps + DEX volumes
- **Status:** ✅ Validated and committed to branch

### Package 2: Control-Layer Analysis (TO INTEGRATE)
- **Core Finding:** Gateway routing—not token taxonomy—determines dollar network effects
- **Exhibits A, B, C, E:** Corridor flows, funding stress, gateway concentration, tokenized assets
- **Data:** Dune SQL on-chain queries + CLII scoring methodology
- **Status:** 🔄 SQL queries ready, needs execution and integration

## CLII-Lite Scoring Methodology

**Control Layer Intensity Index** scores gateways on 5 dimensions:

| Dimension | Weight | Evidence Sources |
|-----------|--------|------------------|
| Regulatory License | 25% | NYDFS BitLicense, state MTLs |
| Reserve Transparency | 20% | Attestation frequency, auditor tier |
| Freeze/Blacklist Capability | 20% | Contract admin functions |
| Compliance Infrastructure | 20% | KYC/AML program scope |
| Geographic Restrictions | 15% | OFAC compliance, geo-blocking |

**Gateway CLII Scores (Reference):**
| Gateway | CLII Score | Tier |
|---------|------------|------|
| Circle (USDC) | 0.92 | Tier 1 |
| Paxos (USDP/PYUSD) | 0.88 | Tier 1 |
| Coinbase | 0.85 | Tier 1 |
| Tether (USDT) | 0.45 | Tier 2 |
| Binance (pre-2024) | 0.38 | Tier 2 |
| Curve/Uniswap | 0.15 | Tier 3 |
| Tornado Cash | 0.02 | Tier 3 |

## API Keys Available

| Service | Key | Status |
|---------|-----|--------|
| FRED | None needed | ✅ Public CSV export |
| DefiLlama | None needed | ✅ Free API |
| Dune Analytics | `HJYpLlltN8HtJmklFnAaMx8QX24m5P98` | ⚠️ Free tier (limited) |

**Dune Limitation:** Free tier cannot create queries or run custom SQL. Only execute existing public queries. The configured query IDs (2589262, 1914532, 2013703) are 404. Query 2416880 returns only 10 rows. Consider upgrading or using alternative on-chain data sources.

**Ready for paper finalization. All monetary policy exhibits validated. Control-layer analysis framework defined.**
