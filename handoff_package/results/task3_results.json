The Pearson correlation between the two aggregate series is r = 0.999992, and the maximum absolute difference in macro-variable correlations is 0.000568 \u2014 well below our 0.02 materiality threshold (N = 1095 daily observations).",
    "paragraph_svb_decomposition": "To illustrate why this distinction is immaterial, consider the largest depeg in our sample: USDC during the Silicon Valley Bank crisis. On 2023-03-12, the implied USDC price dropped to $0.96 as market capitalization diverged from circulating supply. Decomposing the $4.1 billion market-cap decline: 61.4% was attributable to actual supply reduction (redemptions), while only 3.67% of pre-event market capitalization reflected the price deviation. This confirms that even during acute stress, the circulating-supply and market-cap measures are functionally interchangeable for our correlation analysis."
