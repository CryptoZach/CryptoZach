# CryptoZach — GitHub Pages (Institutional)

This repo is a clean, dependency-free GitHub Pages site.

## Quick deploy

1. Create a new GitHub repo (e.g., `cryptozach.github.io` or `cryptozach-site`).
2. Upload the contents of this folder to the repo root.
3. In GitHub: **Settings → Pages**
   - Source: `Deploy from a branch`
   - Branch: `main` (or `master`) / root
4. Wait for GitHub Pages to publish.

## Swap in updated resume

Replace:

- `assets/Zach_Zukowski_Resume.pdf`

Keep the filename the same so the **View Resume** button continues to work.

## Update links

Edit `index.html` and update any URLs (LinkedIn, Medium, X) as desired.
